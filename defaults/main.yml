# action taken on host shutdown
# - suspend   all running guests are suspended using virsh managedsave
# - shutdown  all running guests are asked to shutdown. Please be careful with
#             this settings since there is no way to distinguish between a
#             guest which is stuck or ignores shutdown requests and a guest
#             which just needs a long time to shutdown. When setting

#             value suitable for your guests.
libvirt_on_shutdown_action: shutdown

# Number of guests will be shutdown concurrently, taking effect when
# "ON_SHUTDOWN" is set to "shutdown". If Set to 0, guests will be shutdown one
# after another. Number of guests on shutdown at any time will not exceed number
# set in this variable.
libvirt_on_shutdown_parallel: 2

# Number of seconds we're willing to wait for a guest to shut down. If parallel
# shutdown is enabled, this timeout applies as a timeout for shutting down all
# guests on a single URI defined in the variable URIS. If this is 0, then there
# is no time out (use with caution, as guests might not respond to a shutdown
# request). The default value is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
